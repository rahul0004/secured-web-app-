difference between localstorage and session storage 

session storage keeps data on page reload but looses it when tab is closed 

whereasd local storage keeps data even on tab close it will loose only when browser is closed or cache is cleared 

data is stored as string in these to store an object use JSON.Stringify

if you want to keep variables initialised value after browser refresh then use storage but it's vulnarable to attack
